# The problem
You have a list in a plain .txt format that you'd like to convert into flashcards.

# Setup

Simply gather your data in a txt file format:

- Each card on a separate line
- Choose one unique separator
- Format looks like "set1_card1\<separator\>set2_card1" for the first line
- Set2 will be the side shown first
- Paste the lines into the input field
- Click the cards to flip between front/back
- Press shuffle button to randomize the flashcard study
- Enjoy!
