# The Problem

Tracking progress in Soulsborne games can be overwhelming. With multiple bosses, hidden locations, and intricate item placements, players often rely on memory or external guides to track their progress. Whether you're a completionist aiming for 100% game completion, a speedrunner optimizing your route, or a casual player trying to keep track of defeated bosses, having an efficient tracking tool can enhance the experience.

This is where our **Soulsborne Tracker** comes in‚Äîa streamlined, interactive solution for managing your progress across multiple games in the series.
